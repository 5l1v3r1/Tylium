### ATT&CK

A set of dashboards for sifting the ATT&CK data  from a data coverage perspective. There are more than fifty data sources required to detect the 7081 instances of the 244 numbered techniques. I'm not aware of anyone who has most or all of the 50 data sources. Dashboards measure observed vs. expected (by the matrix) named events. Sample configurations for instrumenting events more completely are part of this project:
