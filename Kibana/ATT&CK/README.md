### attack-dashboards.ndjson

A set of dashboards for sifting the ATT&CK data from a data coverage perspective. There are more than fifty data sources required to detect the 7081 instances of the 244 numbered techniques. I'm not aware of anyone who has most or all of these 50 data sources. Usually people have cloud, endpoint or network data, but not all three. Dashboards measure observed vs. expected (by the matrix) named events. Sample configurations for instrumenting events more completely are part of this project:

### Datasource Matrix

This is a matrix for resolving ATT&CK data sources into specific log classes and events. These are the events and log message types measured in the dashboards.
